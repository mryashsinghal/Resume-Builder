You can report vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

-  **Email**: dpyashsinghal@gmail.com
-  **GitHub Issue**: Create an issue and tag it with `security` (only if the vulnerability is not sensitive or exploitable)

> Do not disclose security issues publicly until we have verified and addressed them.
