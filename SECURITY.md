You can report vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

- 📩 **Email**: [dpyashsinghal@gmail.com]
- 🐛 **GitHub Issue**: Create an issue and tag it with `security` (only if the vulnerability is not sensitive or exploitable)

> Do not disclose security issues publicly until we have verified and addressed them.
